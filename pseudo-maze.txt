5   fuction turn(move)
6	   if move equals 'left' then set left motors forwards and right motors backwards until turned 90 degrees
7	   if move equals 'right' then set left motors backwards and right motors forwards until turned 90 degrees
8	   if move equals 'forward' then set left motors forwards and right motors forwards
9	   
10   for nextMove in listOfMoves
11     read sensor
12     if sensor less than 10cm then turn(nextMove)
13     sleep for 0.1 seconds
